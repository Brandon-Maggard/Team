# Team
Website to show the importance of DE&amp;I.

Team is a non-profit organization that needed a footprint on the web. They wanted to a simple website that would educate people about diversity, equity, and inclusion. Furthermore, they wanted to have a tool on their site that would show how other companies are doing when it comes to diversity on their teams. The approach on this was to help this company with their message by educating other people about these topics by using a responsive site and to use JavaScript to create a tool that other companies can use.
